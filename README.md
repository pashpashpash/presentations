# JSNation Presentation 2025
The way we write code is fundamentally changing. Instead of getting stuck in nested loops and implementation details, imagine focusing purely on architecture and creative problem-solving while your AI pair programmer handles the execution. In this hands-on workshop, I'll show you how to leverage Cline (an autonomous coding agent that recently hit 1M VS Code downloads) to dramatically accelerate your development workflow through a practice we call "vibe coding" - where humans focus on high-level thinking and AI handles the implementation.

You'll discover:
- The fundamental principles of "vibe coding" and how it differs from traditional development
- How to architect solutions at a high level and have AI implement them accurately
- Live demo: Building a production-grade caching system in Go that saved us $500/week
- Techniques for using AI to understand complex codebases in minutes instead of hours
- Best practices for prompting AI agents to get exactly the code you want
- Common pitfalls to avoid when working with AI coding assistants
- Strategies for using AI to accelerate learning and reduce dependency on senior engineers
- How to effectively combine human creativity with AI implementation capabilities
- Whether you're a junior developer looking to accelerate your learning or a senior engineer wanting to optimize your workflow, you'll leave this workshop with practical experience in AI-assisted development that you can immediately apply to your projects. Through live coding demos and hands-on exercises, you'll learn how to leverage Cline to write better code faster while focusing on what matters - solving real problems.
